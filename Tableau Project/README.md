## Overview

This project simulates a real-world business intelligence engagement analyzing the operational performance of a retail superstore.

The goal of the project was to transform transactional retail data into actionable insights that support profitability optimization, product strategy decisions, marketing allocation, and operational risk management.

Using Tableau and analytical modeling, I explored profit drivers, return patterns, geographic performance, and advertising opportunities across multiple business dimensions.

## 🧠 Business Objective

Retail executives rely on data-backed dashboards to guide operational and financial decisions.

This project supports strategic retail planning by answering questions such as:

- Where are profits and losses concentrated?
- Which products and subcategories should be discontinued?
- Where and when is advertising likely to generate positive ROI?
- Which products and customers drive high return rates?
- How do return rates impact profitability across states?

## 🗄️ Database Structure

The analysis is based on a retail transactional dataset containing:

- Orders – Sales, profit, date, product, customer, region
- Returns – Returned order records
- Products – Category and subcategory information
- Customers – Segmentation details
- Geography – State and regional data

Data relationships were modeled using joins within Tableau to connect Orders and Returns.

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Tasks

### 1. Profit & Loss Analysis
- Identified profit centers and loss-making subcategories
- Compared profitability across regions and product segments

### 2. Product Strategy Optimization
- Determined products and subcategories to discontinue
- Highlighted high-margin categories for prioritization

### 3. Advertising Opportunity Analysis
- Analyzed average monthly profit by state
- Identified top-performing state–month combinations
- Estimated reasonable advertising allocation (≈20% of profit)

### 4. Returns Risk Assessment
- Performed LEFT JOIN between Orders and Returns
- Created binary return flag
- Calculated return rates by product and customer

### 5. Profit vs Return Rate Evaluation
Applied business logic framework:

- High profit + Low return → Invest
- Low profit + High return → Reconsider
- High profit + High return → Investigate
- Low profit + Low return → Lower priority
